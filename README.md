# ISMB.mutsig.tutorial

Welcome to the ISMB2020 Online Mutational Signature Analysis Tutorial, July 11 and 12, 2020 (https://www.iscb.org/ismb2020-program/tutorials#tut1)

## Signature extraction excercise is at

https://github.com/steverozen/ISMB.mutsig.tutorial/raw/master/exercise.in.interpreting.extraction.results.zip

The input data was not in the .zip; it is at

https://github.com/steverozen/ISMB.mutsig.tutorial/raw/master/3.types.ground.truth.spectra.1000.size.csv

(1000.size refers to a dispersion parameters I used when adding variance to the spectra.)

## Please do before the tutorial

1.Please have R >= 4.0.0 installed on your computer. You can find the latest release at 
https://cloud.r-project.org/

2.Please install the package ICAMS and its prerequisites from CRAN.
```
install.packages("ICAMS")
```

3.Please install BSgenome.Hsapiens.1000genomes.hs37d5 from Bioconductor:
```
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("BSgenome.Hsapiens.1000genomes.hs37d5")
```
4.Additional R libraries that will be needed:

4.1 CRAN packages: philentropy, gplots, factoextra
```
install.packages("philentropy")
install.packages("gplots")
install.packages("factoextra")
```

4.2 GitHub packages:  

Thare are 2 ways to install these.  

4.2.1 If you do not have Rtools (Windows) or XCode (Mac), then download from 

https://github.com/steverozen/ISMB.mutsig.tutorial/raw/master/PCAWG7_0.0.1.tar.gz

https://github.com/steverozen/ISMB.mutsig.tutorial/raw/master/mSigBG_1.0.0.tar.gz

and put them in the current working directory for your R session, and then
 

```
install.packages("PCAWG7_0.0.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
install.packages("mSigBG_1.0.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```
We think you will get a warning, but we think the installations will work.

4.2.2 

If you have Rtools (Windows) or XCode (Mac), you can install the GitHub
packages with the R command line:
```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("steverozen/mSigBG", ref = "1.0-branch", force = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("steverozen/PCAWG7", force = TRUE)
```

If you want to install Rtools (Windows) or XCode (Mac), the instructions are as follows: 

**Windows:**   
Please download and install Rtools from CRAN: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/.  

**macOS:**   
Please install the Command Line Tools for XCode. You can do this in one of two ways. 

Either:

1. Download and install XCode from the Mac AppStore:
http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12 

2. Within XCode go to Preferences : Downloads and install the Command Line Tools

Or alternatively (for a smaller download size):

1. Register as an Apple Developer (free) here: https://developer.apple.com/programs/register/

2. Download the Command Line Tools for XCode appropriate for the version of macOS you are running from here: https://developer.apple.com/downloads/  

**Linux:**    
For Debian/Ubuntu, you can install the development utilities required by executing:

```
sudo apt-get install r-base-dev
```
For other versions of Linux please consult their documentation to determine how to install a basic GNU development tool chain.   

If you have difficulties contact Nanhai JIANG at nanhai.jiang@u.duke.nus.edu.

You will need R and the above packages for the practicum on July 11.
